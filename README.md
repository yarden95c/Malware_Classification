## Description

The goal of Microsoft Malware Classification challenge is to classify malwares into 9 classes.
In our model we needed to classify into 8 malware classes and 1 benign class.
Our approach is based only on ‘Interesting’ opcode N-gram (using Xgboost)


## Dependency

Please make sure each of them is installed with the correct version

- numpy (1.14.0)
- pandas (0.22.0)
- xgboost (0.72)
- sklearn (0.19.1)
- matplotlib (2.1.2)
- glob (0.6)
- math (1.0.0)

We used python **2.7** for this project. 

## Getting Started

get the project with
````
git clone  https://github.com/yarden95c/Malware_Classification.git
````
###### Setup 

*   Directories and files:
    *   Open 'Data' directory
    *   Split your files into 'train' and 'test' directories
*   Update the trainLabels.csv file according to your files (benign is Class 0)

The path.txt should contains 4 lines:
1.  Path to your 'Data' directory  
2.  Path to your 'train' directory
3.  Path to your 'test' directory
4.  Path to your 'trainLabels.csv' file


## Running the project

````
./run_model.sh

````

#### Output

At the end of the running the model will print the confusion matrix and will print the percent of success in the full
classification (all of the 8 classes and benign) and the percent of success in the binary classification (benign or malware)

Output example:

```
total success is: 170, from 177, in percent: (96%) 
benign success is: 16, from 16, in percent: (100%) 
benign fail is: 0, from 16, in percent: (0%) 
```


##### Submission file


The project will write a submission.csv file. 
In that file we will predict the test files.
