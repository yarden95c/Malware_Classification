# Malware Classification

The goal of Microsoft Malware Classification challenge is to classify malwares into 9 classes.
In our model we needed to classify into 8 malware classes and 1 benign class.
Our approach is based only on ‘Interesting’ opcode N-gram (using Xgboost)

## Getting Started

get the project with
````
git clone  https://github.com/yarden95c/Malware_Classification.git
````

######Organize the data 6

#####Organize the data 5

####Organize the data 4

###Organize the data 3

##Organize the data 2

#Organize the data 1


*   Directories and files:
    *   Open 'Data' directory
    *   Split your files into 'train' and 'test' directories
*   Update the trainLabels.csv file according to your files (benign is Class 0)

The path.txt should contains 4 lines:
1.  Path to your 'Data' directory  
2.  Path to your 'train' directory
3.  Path to your 'test' directory
4.  Path to your 'trainLabels.csv' file



## Running the project

````
./run_model.sh

````

#### Output

At the end of the running the model will print the confusion matrix and will print the percent of success in the full
classification (all of the 8 classes and benign) and the percent of success in the binary classification (benign or malware)

Example

```
Give an example
```


#####Submission file


The project will write a submission.csv file.
In that file we will predict the test files.
